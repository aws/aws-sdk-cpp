     * that are in the <code>UPDATE_FAILED</code> state because a rollback failed. You
     * can't specify resources that are in the <code>UPDATE_FAILED</code> state for
     * other reasons, for example, because an update was canceled. To check why a
     * resource update failed, use the <a>DescribeStackResources</a> action, and view
     * the resource status reason. </p> <important> <p>Specify this property to skip
     * rolling back resources that AWS CloudFormation can't successfully roll back. We
     * recommend that you <a
     * href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/troubleshooting.html#troubleshooting-errors-update-rollback-failed">
     * troubleshoot</a> resources before skipping them. AWS CloudFormation sets the
     * status of the specified resources to <code>UPDATE_COMPLETE</code> and continues
     * to roll back the stack. After the rollback is complete, the state of the skipped
     * resources will be inconsistent with the state of the resources in the stack
     * template. Before performing another stack update, you must update the stack or
     * resources to be consistent with each other. If you don't, subsequent stack
     * updates might fail, and the stack will become unrecoverable. </p> </important>
     * <p>Specify the minimum number of resources required to successfully roll back
     * your stack. For example, a failed resource update might cause dependent
     * resources to fail. In this case, it might not be necessary to skip the dependent
     * resources. </p> <p>To specify resources in a nested stack, use the following
     * format: <code>NestedStackName.ResourceLogicalID</code>. You can specify a nested
     * stack resource (the logical ID of an <code>AWS::CloudFormation::Stack</code>
     * resource) only if it's in one of the following states:
     * <code>DELETE_IN_PROGRESS</code>, <code>DELETE_COMPLETE</code>, or
     * <code>DELETE_FAILED</code>. </p>
