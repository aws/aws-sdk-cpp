   * <p>The dependencies defined for container startup and shutdown. A container can

   * instances require at least version 1.26.0 of the container agent to use
   * container dependencies. However, we recommend using the latest container agent
   * version. For information about checking your agent version and updating to the
   * latest version, see <a
   * href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/ecs-agent-update.html">Updating
   * the Amazon ECS Container Agent</a> in the <i>Amazon Elastic Container Service
   * Developer Guide</i>. If you're using an Amazon ECS-optimized Linux AMI, your
   * instance needs at least version 1.26.0-1 of the <code>ecs-init</code> package.
   * If your container instances are launched from version <code>20190301</code> or
   * later, then they contain the required versions of the container agent and
   * <code>ecs-init</code>. For more information, see <a
   * href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/ecs-optimized_AMI.html">Amazon
   * ECS-optimized Linux AMI</a> in the <i>Amazon Elastic Container Service Developer
   * Guide</i>.</p>  <p>For tasks that use the Fargate launch type, the task or
   * service requires the following platforms:</p> <ul> <li> <p>Linux platform
