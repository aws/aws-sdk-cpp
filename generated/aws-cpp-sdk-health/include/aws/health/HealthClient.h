  /**
   * <fullname>Health</fullname> <p>The Health API provides programmatic access to
   * the Health information that appears in the <a
   * href="https://phd.aws.amazon.com/phd/home#/">Personal Health Dashboard</a>. You
   * can use the API operations to get information about events that might affect
   * your Amazon Web Services services and resources.</p>  <ul> <li> <p>You
   * must have a Business, Enterprise On-Ramp, or Enterprise Support plan from <a
   * href="http://aws.amazon.com/premiumsupport/">Amazon Web Services Support</a> to
   * use the Health API. If you call the Health API from an Amazon Web Services
   * account that doesn't have a Business, Enterprise On-Ramp, or Enterprise Support
   * plan, you receive a <code>SubscriptionRequiredException</code> error.</p> </li>
   * <li> <p>You can use the Health endpoint health.us-east-1.amazonaws.com (HTTPS)
   * to call the Health API operations. Health supports a multi-Region application
   * architecture and has two regional endpoints in an active-passive configuration.
   * You can use the high availability endpoint example to determine which Amazon Web
   * Services Region is active, so that you can get the latest information from the
   * API. For more information, see <a
   * href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/health/latest/ug/health-api.html">Accessing
   * the Health API</a> in the <i>Health User Guide</i>.</p> </li> </ul> 
   * <p>For authentication of requests, Health uses the <a
   * href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/signature-version-4.html">Signature
   * Version 4 Signing Process</a>.</p> <p>If your Amazon Web Services account is
   * part of Organizations, you can use the Health organizational view feature. This
   * feature provides a centralized view of Health events across all accounts in your
   * organization. You can aggregate Health events in real time to identify accounts
   * in your organization that are affected by an operational event or get notified
   * of security vulnerabilities. Use the organizational view API operations to
   * enable this feature and return event information. For more information, see <a
   * href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/health/latest/ug/aggregate-events.html">Aggregating
   * Health events</a> in the <i>Health User Guide</i>.</p>  <p>When you use
   * the Health API operations to return Health events, see the following
   * recommendations:</p> <ul> <li> <p>Use the <a
   * href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/health/latest/APIReference/API_Event.html#AWSHealth-Type-Event-eventScopeCode">eventScopeCode</a>
   * parameter to specify whether to return Health events that are public or
   * account-specific.</p> </li> <li> <p>Use pagination to view all events from the
   * response. For example, if you call the
   * <code>DescribeEventsForOrganization</code> operation to get all events in your
   * organization, you might receive several page results. Specify the
   * <code>nextToken</code> in the next request to return more results.</p> </li>
   * </ul>
