   * <b>Endpoint to call When using the CLI or the Amazon Web Services SDK</b> </p>
   * <p>For the current release of Organizations, specify the <code>us-east-1</code>
   * region for all Amazon Web Services API and CLI calls made from the commercial
   * Amazon Web Services Regions outside of China. If calling from one of the Amazon
   * Web Services Regions in China, then specify <code>cn-northwest-1</code>. You can
   * do this in the CLI by using these parameters and commands:</p> <ul> <li> <p>Use
   * the following parameter with each command to specify both the endpoint and its
   * region:</p> <p> <code>--endpoint-url
   * https://organizations.us-east-1.amazonaws.com</code> <i>(from commercial Amazon
   * Web Services Regions outside of China)</i> </p> <p>or</p> <p>
   * <code>--endpoint-url
   * https://organizations.cn-northwest-1.amazonaws.com.cn</code> <i>(from Amazon Web
   * Services Regions in China)</i> </p> </li> <li> <p>Use the default endpoint, but
   * configure your default region with this command:</p> <p> <code>aws configure set
   * default.region us-east-1</code> <i>(from commercial Amazon Web Services Regions
   * outside of China)</i> </p> <p>or</p> <p> <code>aws configure set default.region
   * cn-northwest-1</code> <i>(from Amazon Web Services Regions in China)</i> </p>
   * </li> <li> <p>Use the following parameter with each command to specify the
   * endpoint:</p> <p> <code>--region us-east-1</code> <i>(from commercial Amazon Web
   * Services Regions outside of China)</i> </p> <p>or</p> <p> <code>--region
   * cn-northwest-1</code> <i>(from Amazon Web Services Regions in China)</i> </p>
   * </li> </ul> <p> <b>Recording API Requests</b> </p> <p>Organizations supports
   * CloudTrail, a service that records Amazon Web Services API calls for your Amazon
   * Web Services account and delivers log files to an Amazon S3 bucket. By using
   * information collected by CloudTrail, you can determine which requests the
   * Organizations service received, who made the request and when, and so on. For
   * more about Organizations and its support for CloudTrail, see <a

         * a few minutes before you can successfully access the account. To check the

         * <code>OperationId</code> response element from this operation to provide as a
         * parameter to the <a>DescribeCreateAccountStatus</a> operation.</p> </li> <li>

         * you create two accounts: a standalone account in the Amazon Web Services
         * GovCloud (US) Region and an associated account in the commercial Region for
         * billing and support purposes. The account in the commercial Region is
         * automatically a member of the organization whose credentials made the request.
         * Both accounts are associated with the same email address.</p> <p>A role is
         * created in the new account in the commercial Region that allows the management
         * account in the organization in the commercial Region to assume it. An Amazon Web
         * Services GovCloud (US) account is then created and associated with the
