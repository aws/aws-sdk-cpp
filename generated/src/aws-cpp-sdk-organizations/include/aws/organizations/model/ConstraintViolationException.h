   * <p>Performing this operation violates a minimum or maximum value limit. For
   * example, attempting to remove the last service control policy (SCP) from an OU
   * or root, inviting or creating too many accounts to the organization, or
   * attaching too many policies to an account, OU, or root. This exception includes
   * a reason that contains additional information about the violated limit:</p>
   *  <p>Some of the reasons in the following list might not be applicable to
   * this specific API or operation.</p>  <ul> <li>
   * <p>ACCOUNT_CANNOT_LEAVE_ORGANIZATION: You attempted to remove the management
   * account from the organization. You can't remove the management account. Instead,
   * after you remove all member accounts, delete the organization itself.</p> </li>
   * <li> <p>ACCOUNT_CANNOT_LEAVE_WITHOUT_PHONE_VERIFICATION: You attempted to remove
   * an account from the organization that doesn't yet have enough information to
   * exist as a standalone account. This account requires you to first complete phone
   * verification. Follow the steps at <a
   * href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/organizations/latest/userguide/orgs_manage_accounts_remove.html#orgs_manage_accounts_remove-from-master">Removing
   * a member account from your organization</a> in the <i>Organizations User
   * Guide.</i> </p> </li> <li> <p>ACCOUNT_CREATION_RATE_LIMIT_EXCEEDED: You
   * attempted to exceed the number of accounts that you can create in one day.</p>
   * </li> <li> <p>ACCOUNT_CREATION_NOT_COMPLETE: Your account setup isn't complete
   * or your account isn't fully active. You must complete the account setup before
   * you create an organization.</p> </li> <li> <p>ACCOUNT_NUMBER_LIMIT_EXCEEDED: You
   * attempted to exceed the limit on the number of accounts in an organization. If
   * you need more accounts, contact <a
   * href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/support/home#/">Amazon Web Services
   * Support</a> to request an increase in your limit. </p> <p>Or the number of
   * invitations that you tried to send would cause you to exceed the limit of
   * accounts in your organization. Send fewer invitations or contact Amazon Web
   * Services Support to request an increase in the number of accounts.</p> 
   * <p>Deleted and closed accounts still count toward your limit.</p> 
   *  <p>If you get this exception when running a command immediately
   * after creating the organization, wait one hour and try again. After an hour, if
   * the command continues to fail with this error, contact <a
   * href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/support/home#/">Amazon Web Services
   * Support</a>.</p>  </li> <li>
   * <p>CANNOT_REGISTER_MASTER_AS_DELEGATED_ADMINISTRATOR: You attempted to register
   * the management account of the organization as a delegated administrator for an
   * Amazon Web Services service integrated with Organizations. You can designate
   * only a member account as a delegated administrator.</p> </li> <li>
   * <p>CANNOT_CLOSE_MANAGEMENT_ACCOUNT: You attempted to close the management
   * account. To close the management account for the organization, you must first
   * either remove or close all member accounts in the organization. Follow standard
   * account closure process using root credentials.​ </p> </li> <li>
   * <p>CANNOT_REMOVE_DELEGATED_ADMINISTRATOR_FROM_ORG: You attempted to remove an
   * account that is registered as a delegated administrator for a service integrated
   * with your organization. To complete this operation, you must first deregister
   * this account as a delegated administrator. </p> </li> <li>
   * <p>CLOSE_ACCOUNT_QUOTA_EXCEEDED: You have exceeded close account quota for the
   * past 30 days. </p> </li> <li> <p>CLOSE_ACCOUNT_REQUESTS_LIMIT_EXCEEDED: You
   * attempted to exceed the number of accounts that you can close at a time. ​ </p>
   * </li> <li> <p>CREATE_ORGANIZATION_IN_BILLING_MODE_UNSUPPORTED_REGION: To create
   * an organization in the specified region, you must enable all features mode.</p>
   * </li> <li> <p>DELEGATED_ADMINISTRATOR_EXISTS_FOR_THIS_SERVICE: You attempted to
   * register an Amazon Web Services account as a delegated administrator for an
   * Amazon Web Services service that already has a delegated administrator. To
   * complete this operation, you must first deregister any existing delegated
   * administrators for this service.</p> </li> <li>
   * <p>EMAIL_VERIFICATION_CODE_EXPIRED: The email verification code is only valid
   * for a limited period of time. You must resubmit the request and generate a new
   * verfication code.</p> </li> <li> <p>HANDSHAKE_RATE_LIMIT_EXCEEDED: You attempted
   * to exceed the number of handshakes that you can send in one day.</p> </li> <li>
   * <p>INVALID_PAYMENT_INSTRUMENT: You cannot remove an account because no supported
   * payment method is associated with the account. Amazon Web Services does not
   * support cards issued by financial institutions in Russia or Belarus. For more
   * information, see <a
   * href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/awsaccountbilling/latest/aboutv2/manage-general.html">Managing
   * your Amazon Web Services payments</a>.</p> </li> <li>
   * <p>MASTER_ACCOUNT_ADDRESS_DOES_NOT_MATCH_MARKETPLACE: To create an account in
   * this organization, you first must migrate the organization's management account
   * to the marketplace that corresponds to the management account's address. For

   * marketplace.</p> </li> <li> <p>MASTER_ACCOUNT_MISSING_BUSINESS_LICENSE: Applies

   * organization, the master must have a valid business license. For more

   * management account must have an associated account in the Amazon Web Services
