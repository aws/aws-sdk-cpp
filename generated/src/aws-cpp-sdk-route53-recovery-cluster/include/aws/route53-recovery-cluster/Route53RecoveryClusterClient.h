  /**
   * <p>Welcome to the Routing Control (Recovery Cluster) API Reference Guide for
   * Amazon Route 53 Application Recovery Controller.</p> <p>With Route 53 ARC, you
   * can use routing control with extreme reliability to recover applications by
   * rerouting traffic across Availability Zones or Amazon Web Services Regions.
   * Routing controls are simple on/off switches hosted on a highly available cluster
   * in Route 53 ARC. A cluster provides a set of five redundant Regional endpoints
   * against which you can run API calls to get or update the state of routing
   * controls. To implement failover, you set one routing control to ON and another
   * one to OFF, to reroute traffic from one Availability Zone or Amazon Web Services
   * Region to another. </p> <p> <i>Be aware that you must specify a Regional
   * endpoint for a cluster when you work with API cluster operations to get or
   * update routing control states in Route 53 ARC.</i> In addition, you must specify
   * the US West (Oregon) Region for Route 53 ARC API calls. For example, use the
   * parameter <code>--region us-west-2</code> with AWS CLI commands. For more
   * information, see <a
   * href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/r53recovery/latest/dg/routing-control.update.api.html">
   * Get and update routing control states using the API</a> in the Amazon Route 53
   * Application Recovery Controller Developer Guide.</p> <p>This API guide includes
   * information about the API operations for how to get and update routing control
   * states in Route 53 ARC. To work with routing control in Route 53 ARC, you must
   * first create the required components (clusters, control panels, and routing
   * controls) using the recovery cluster configuration API.</p> <p>For more
   * information about working with routing control in Route 53 ARC, see the
   * following:</p> <ul> <li> <p>Create clusters, control panels, and routing
   * controls by using API operations. For more information, see the <a
   * href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/recovery-cluster/latest/api/">Recovery Control
   * Configuration API Reference Guide for Amazon Route 53 Application Recovery
   * Controller</a>.</p> </li> <li> <p>Learn about the components in recovery
   * control, including clusters, routing controls, and control panels, and how to
   * work with Route 53 ARC in the Amazon Web Services console. For more information,
   * see <a

   * Recovery control components</a> in the Amazon Route 53 Application Recovery
   * Controller Developer Guide.</p> </li> <li> <p>Route 53 ARC also provides
   * readiness checks that continually audit resources to help make sure that your
   * applications are scaled and ready to handle failover traffic. For more
