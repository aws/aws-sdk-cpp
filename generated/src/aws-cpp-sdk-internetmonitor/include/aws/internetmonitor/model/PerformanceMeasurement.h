   * <p>Measurements about the performance for your application on the internet
   * calculated by Amazon CloudWatch Internet Monitor. Amazon Web Services has
   * substantial historical data about internet performance and availability between
   * Amazon Web Services services and different network providers and geographies. By
   * applying statistical analysis to the data, Internet Monitor can detect when the
   * performance and availability for your application has dropped, compared to an
   * estimated baseline that's already calculated. To make it easier to see those
   * drops, we report that information to you in the form of health scores: a
   * performance score and an availability score.</p> <p>Performance in Internet
   * Monitor represents the estimated percentage of traffic that is not seeing a
   * performance drop. For example, a performance score of 99% for an end user and
   * service location pair is equivalent to 1% of the traffic experiencing a
   * performance drop for that pair.</p> <p>For more information, see <a
