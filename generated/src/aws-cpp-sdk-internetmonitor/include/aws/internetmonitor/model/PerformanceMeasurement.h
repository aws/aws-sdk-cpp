   * <p>Amazon CloudWatch Internet Monitor calculates measurements about the
   * performance for your application's internet traffic between client locations and
   * Amazon Web Services. Amazon Web Services has substantial historical data about
   * internet performance and availability between Amazon Web Services services and
   * different network providers and geographies. By applying statistical analysis to
   * the data, Internet Monitor can detect when the performance and availability for
   * your application has dropped, compared to an estimated baseline that's already
   * calculated. To make it easier to see those drops, we report that information to
   * you in the form of health scores: a performance score and an availability
   * score.</p> <p>Performance in Internet Monitor represents the estimated
   * percentage of traffic that is not seeing a performance drop. For example, a
   * performance score of 99% for an end user and service location pair is equivalent
   * to 1% of the traffic experiencing a performance drop for that pair.</p> <p>For
   * more information, see <a
   * href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/CloudWatch-IM-inside-internet-monitor.html#IMExperienceScores">How
   * Internet Monitor calculates performance and availability scores</a> in the
   * Amazon CloudWatch Internet Monitor section of the <i>CloudWatch User
   * Guide</i>.</p><p><h3>See Also:</h3>   <a
