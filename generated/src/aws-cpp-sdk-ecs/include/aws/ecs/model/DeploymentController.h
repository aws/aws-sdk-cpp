  /**
   * <p>The deployment controller type to use.</p> <p>The deployment controller is
   * the mechanism that determines how tasks are deployed for your service. The valid
   * options are:</p> <ul> <li> <p>ECS</p> <p>When you create a service which uses
   * the <code>ECS</code> deployment controller, you can choose between the following
   * deployment strategies:</p> <ul> <li> <p> <code>ROLLING</code>: When you create a
   * service which uses the <i>rolling update</i> (<code>ROLLING</code>) deployment
   * strategy, the Amazon ECS service scheduler replaces the currently running tasks
   * with new tasks. The number of tasks that Amazon ECS adds or removes from the
   * service during a rolling update is controlled by the service deployment
   * configuration. </p> <p>Rolling update deployments are best suited for the
   * following scenarios:</p> <ul> <li> <p>Gradual service updates: You need to
   * update your service incrementally without taking the entire service offline at
   * once.</p> </li> <li> <p>Limited resource requirements: You want to avoid the
   * additional resource costs of running two complete environments simultaneously
   * (as required by blue/green deployments).</p> </li> <li> <p>Acceptable deployment
   * time: Your application can tolerate a longer deployment process, as rolling
   * updates replace tasks one by one.</p> </li> <li> <p>No need for instant roll
   * back: Your service can tolerate a rollback process that takes minutes rather
   * than seconds.</p> </li> <li> <p>Simple deployment process: You prefer a
   * straightforward deployment approach without the complexity of managing multiple
   * environments, target groups, and listeners.</p> </li> <li> <p>No load balancer
   * requirement: Your service doesn't use or require a load balancer, Application
   * Load Balancer, Network Load Balancer, or Service Connect (which are required for
   * blue/green deployments).</p> </li> <li> <p>Stateful applications: Your
   * application maintains state that makes it difficult to run two parallel
   * environments.</p> </li> <li> <p>Cost sensitivity: You want to minimize
   * deployment costs by not running duplicate environments during deployment.</p>
   * </li> </ul> <p>Rolling updates are the default deployment strategy for services
   * and provide a balance between deployment safety and resource efficiency for many
   * common application scenarios.</p> </li> <li> <p> <code>BLUE_GREEN</code>: A
   * <i>blue/green</i> deployment strategy (<code>BLUE_GREEN</code>) is a release
   * methodology that reduces downtime and risk by running two identical production
   * environments called blue and green. With Amazon ECS blue/green deployments, you
   * can validate new service revisions before directing production traffic to them.
   * This approach provides a safer way to deploy changes with the ability to quickly
   * roll back if needed.</p> <p>Amazon ECS blue/green deployments are best suited
   * for the following scenarios:</p> <ul> <li> <p>Service validation: When you need
   * to validate new service revisions before directing production traffic to
   * them</p> </li> <li> <p>Zero downtime: When your service requires zero-downtime
   * deployments</p> </li> <li> <p>Instant roll back: When you need the ability to
   * quickly roll back if issues are detected</p> </li> <li> <p>Load balancer
   * requirement: When your service uses Application Load Balancer, Network Load
   * Balancer, or Service Connect</p> </li> </ul> </li> </ul> </li> <li>
   * <p>External</p> <p>Use a third-party deployment controller.</p> </li> <li>
   * <p>Blue/green deployment (powered by CodeDeploy)</p> <p>CodeDeploy installs an
   * updated version of the application as a new replacement task set and reroutes
   * production traffic from the original application task set to the replacement
   * task set. The original task set is terminated after a successful deployment. Use
   * this deployment controller to verify a new deployment of a service before
   * sending production traffic to it.</p> </li> </ul>
