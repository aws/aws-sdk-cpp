  /**
   * <fullname>Health</fullname> <p>The Health API provides access to the Health
   * information that appears in the <a
   * href="https://health.aws.amazon.com/health/home">Health Dashboard</a>. You can
   * use the API operations to get information about events that might affect your
   * Amazon Web Services and resources.</p> <p>You must have a Business, Enterprise
   * On-Ramp, or Enterprise Support plan from <a
   * href="http://aws.amazon.com/premiumsupport/">Amazon Web Services Support</a> to
   * use the Health API. If you call the Health API from an Amazon Web Services
   * account that doesn't have a Business, Enterprise On-Ramp, or Enterprise Support
   * plan, you receive a <code>SubscriptionRequiredException</code> error.</p> <p>For
   * API access, you need an access key ID and a secret access key. Use temporary
   * credentials instead of long-term access keys when possible. Temporary
   * credentials include an access key ID, a secret access key, and a security token
   * that indicates when the credentials expire. For more information, see <a
   * href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/aws-access-keys-best-practices.html">Best
   * practices for managing Amazon Web Services access keys</a> in the <i>Amazon Web
   * Services General Reference</i>.</p> <p>You can use the Health endpoint
   * health.us-east-1.amazonaws.com (HTTPS) to call the Health API operations. Health
   * supports a multi-Region application architecture and has two regional endpoints
   * in an active-passive configuration. You can use the high availability endpoint
   * example to determine which Amazon Web Services Region is active, so that you can
   * get the latest information from the API. For more information, see <a
   * href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/health/latest/ug/health-api.html">Accessing
   * the Health API</a> in the <i>Health User Guide</i>.</p> <p>For authentication of
   * requests, Health uses the <a
   * href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/signature-version-4.html">Signature
   * Version 4 Signing Process</a>.</p> <p>If your Amazon Web Services account is
   * part of Organizations, you can use the Health organizational view feature. This
   * feature provides a centralized view of Health events across all accounts in your
   * organization. You can aggregate Health events in real time to identify accounts
   * in your organization that are affected by an operational event or get notified
   * of security vulnerabilities. Use the organizational view API operations to
   * enable this feature and return event information. For more information, see <a
   * href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/health/latest/ug/aggregate-events.html">Aggregating
   * Health events</a> in the <i>Health User Guide</i>.</p>  <p>When you use
   * the Health API operations to return Health events, see the following
   * recommendations:</p> <ul> <li> <p>Use the <a
   * href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/health/latest/APIReference/API_Event.html#AWSHealth-Type-Event-eventScopeCode">eventScopeCode</a>
   * parameter to specify whether to return Health events that are public or
   * account-specific.</p> </li> <li> <p>Use pagination to view all events from the
   * response. For example, if you call the
   * <code>DescribeEventsForOrganization</code> operation to get all events in your
   * organization, you might receive several page results. Specify the
   * <code>nextToken</code> in the next request to return more results.</p> </li>
