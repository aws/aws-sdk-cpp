     * <p>The scan status. Possible return values and descriptions are: </p> <p>
     * <code>PENDING_INITIAL_SCAN</code> - This resource has been identified for
     * scanning, results will be available soon.</p> <p> <code>ACCESS_DENIED</code> -
     * Resource access policy restricting Amazon Inspector access. Please update the
     * IAM policy.</p> <p> <code>INTERNAL_ERROR</code> - Amazon Inspector has
     * encountered an internal error for this resource. Amazon Inspector service will
     * automatically resolve the issue and resume the scanning. No action required from
     * the user.</p> <p> <code>UNMANAGED_EC2_INSTANCE</code> - The EC2 instance is not
     * managed by SSM, please use the following SSM automation to remediate the issue:
     * <a
     * href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/systems-manager-automation-runbooks/latest/userguide/automation-awssupport-troubleshoot-managed-instance.html">https://docs.aws.amazon.com/systems-manager-automation-runbooks/latest/userguide/automation-awssupport-troubleshoot-managed-instance.html</a>.
     * Once the instance becomes managed by SSM, Inspector will automatically begin
     * scanning this instance. </p> <p> <code>UNSUPPORTED_OS</code> - Amazon Inspector
     * does not support this OS, architecture, or image manifest type at this time. To
     * see a complete list of supported operating systems see: <a href="
     * https://docs.aws.amazon.com/inspector/latest/user/supported.html">https://docs.aws.amazon.com/inspector/latest/user/supported.html</a>.</p>
     * <p> <code>SCAN_ELIGIBILITY_EXPIRED</code> - The configured scan duration has
     * lapsed for this image.</p> <p> <code>RESOURCE_TERMINATED</code> - This resource
     * has been terminated. The findings and coverage associated with this resource are
     * in the process of being cleaned up.</p> <p> <code>SUCCESSFUL</code> - The scan
     * was successful.</p> <p> <code>NO_RESOURCES_FOUND</code> - Reserved for future
     * use.</p> <p> <code>IMAGE_SIZE_EXCEEDED</code> - Reserved for future use.</p> <p>
     * <code>SCAN_FREQUENCY_MANUAL</code> - This image will not be covered by Amazon
     * Inspector due to the repository scan frequency configuration.</p> <p>
     * <code>SCAN_FREQUENCY_SCAN_ON_PUSH </code>- This image will be scanned one time
     * and will not new findings because of the scan frequency configuration.</p> <p>
     * <code>EC2_INSTANCE_STOPPED</code> - This EC2 instance is in a stopped state,
     * therefore, Amazon Inspector will pause scanning. The existing findings will
     * continue to exist until the instance is terminated. Once the instance is
     * re-started, Inspector will automatically start scanning the instance again.
     * Please note that you will not be charged for this instance while it’s in a
     * stopped state.</p> <p> <code>PENDING_DISABLE</code> - This resource is pending
     * cleanup during disablement. The customer will not be billed while a resource is
     * in the pending disable status.</p> <p> <code>NO INVENTORY</code> - Amazon
     * Inspector couldn’t find software application inventory to scan for
     * vulnerabilities. This might be caused due to required Amazon Inspector
     * associations being deleted or failing to run on your resource. Please verify the
     * status of <code>InspectorInventoryCollection-do-not-delete</code> association in
     * the SSM console for the resource. Additionally, you can verify the instance’s
     * inventory in the SSM Fleet Manager console.</p> <p> <code>STALE_INVENTORY</code>
     * - Amazon Inspector wasn’t able to collect an updated software application
     * inventory in the last 7 days. Please confirm the required Amazon Inspector
     * associations still exist and you can still see an updated inventory in the SSM
     * console.</p> <p> <code>EXCLUDED_BY_TAG</code> - This resource was not scanned
     * because it has been excluded by a tag.</p> <p> <code>UNSUPPORTED_RUNTIME</code>
     * - The function was not scanned because it has an unsupported runtime. To see a
     * complete list of supported runtimes see: <a href="
     * https://docs.aws.amazon.com/inspector/latest/user/supported.html">https://docs.aws.amazon.com/inspector/latest/user/supported.html</a>.</p>
     * <p> <code>UNSUPPORTED_MEDIA_TYPE </code>- The ECR image has an unsupported media
     * type.</p> <p> <code>UNSUPPORTED_CONFIG_FILE</code> - Reserved for future
     * use.</p> <p> <code>DEEP_INSPECTION_PACKAGE_COLLECTION_LIMIT_EXCEEDED</code> -
     * The instance has exceeded the 5000 package limit for Amazon Inspector Deep
     * inspection. To resume Deep inspection for this instance you can try to adjust
     * the custom paths associated with the account.</p> <p>
     * <code>DEEP_INSPECTION_DAILY_SSM_INVENTORY_LIMIT_EXCEEDED</code> - The SSM agent
     * couldn't send inventory to Amazon Inspector because the SSM quota for Inventory
     * data collected per instance per day has already been reached for this
     * instance.</p> <p> <code>DEEP_INSPECTION_COLLECTION_TIME_LIMIT_EXCEEDED</code> -
     * Amazon Inspector failed to extract the package inventory because the package
     * collection time exceeding the maximum threshold of 15 minutes.</p> <p>
     * <code>DEEP_INSPECTION_NO_INVENTORY</code> The Amazon Inspector plugin hasn't yet
     * been able to collect an inventory of packages for this instance. This is usually
     * the result of a pending scan, however, if this status persists after 6 hours,
     * use SSM to ensure that the required Amazon Inspector associations exist and are
     * running for the instance.</p> <p/>
