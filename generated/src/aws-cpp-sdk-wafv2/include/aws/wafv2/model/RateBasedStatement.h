  /**
   * <p>A rate-based rule counts incoming requests and rate limits requests when they
   * are coming at too fast a rate. The rule categorizes requests according to your
   * aggregation criteria, collects them into aggregation instances, and counts and
   * rate limits the requests for each instance. </p> <p>You can specify individual
   * aggregation keys, like IP address or HTTP method. You can also specify
   * aggregation key combinations, like IP address and HTTP method, or HTTP method,
   * query argument, and cookie. </p> <p>Each unique set of values for the
   * aggregation keys that you specify is a separate aggregation instance, with the
   * value from each key contributing to the aggregation instance definition. </p>
   * <p>For example, assume the rule evaluates web requests with the following IP
   * address and HTTP method values: </p> <ul> <li> <p>IP address 10.1.1.1, HTTP
   * method POST</p> </li> <li> <p>IP address 10.1.1.1, HTTP method GET</p> </li>
   * <li> <p>IP address 127.0.0.0, HTTP method POST</p> </li> <li> <p>IP address
   * 10.1.1.1, HTTP method GET</p> </li> </ul> <p>The rule would create different
   * aggregation instances according to your aggregation criteria, for example: </p>
   * <ul> <li> <p>If the aggregation criteria is just the IP address, then each
   * individual address is an aggregation instance, and WAF counts requests
   * separately for each. The aggregation instances and request counts for our
   * example would be the following: </p> <ul> <li> <p>IP address 10.1.1.1: count
   * 3</p> </li> <li> <p>IP address 127.0.0.0: count 1</p> </li> </ul> </li> <li>
   * <p>If the aggregation criteria is HTTP method, then each individual HTTP method
   * is an aggregation instance. The aggregation instances and request counts for our
   * example would be the following: </p> <ul> <li> <p>HTTP method POST: count 2</p>
   * </li> <li> <p>HTTP method GET: count 2</p> </li> </ul> </li> <li> <p>If the
   * aggregation criteria is IP address and HTTP method, then each IP address and
   * each HTTP method would contribute to the combined aggregation instance. The
   * aggregation instances and request counts for our example would be the following:
   * </p> <ul> <li> <p>IP address 10.1.1.1, HTTP method POST: count 1</p> </li> <li>
   * <p>IP address 10.1.1.1, HTTP method GET: count 2</p> </li> <li> <p>IP address
   * 127.0.0.0, HTTP method POST: count 1</p> </li> </ul> </li> </ul> <p>For any
   * n-tuple of aggregation keys, each unique combination of values for the keys
   * defines a separate aggregation instance, which WAF counts and rate-limits
   * individually. </p> <p>You can optionally nest another statement inside the
   * rate-based statement, to narrow the scope of the rule so that it only counts and
   * rate limits requests that match the nested statement. You can use this nested
   * scope-down statement in conjunction with your aggregation key specifications or
   * you can just count and rate limit all requests that match the scope-down
   * statement, without additional aggregation. When you choose to just manage all
   * requests that match a scope-down statement, the aggregation instance is singular
   * for the rule. </p> <p>You cannot nest a <code>RateBasedStatement</code> inside
   * another statement, for example inside a <code>NotStatement</code> or
   * <code>OrStatement</code>. You can define a <code>RateBasedStatement</code>
   * inside a web ACL and inside a rule group. </p> <p>For additional information
   * about the options, see <a
   * href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/waf/latest/developerguide/waf-rate-based-rules.html">Rate
   * limiting web requests using rate-based rules</a> in the <i>WAF Developer
   * Guide</i>. </p> <p>If you only aggregate on the individual IP address or
   * forwarded IP address, you can retrieve the list of IP addresses that WAF is
   * currently rate limiting for a rule through the API call
   * <code>GetRateBasedStatementManagedKeys</code>. This option is not available for
   * other aggregation configurations.</p> <p>WAF tracks and manages web requests
   * separately for each instance of a rate-based rule that you use. For example, if
   * you provide the same rate-based rule settings in two web ACLs, each of the two
   * rule statements represents a separate instance of the rate-based rule and gets
   * its own tracking and management by WAF. If you define a rate-based rule inside a
   * rule group, and then use that rule group in multiple places, each use creates a
   * separate instance of the rate-based rule that gets its own tracking and
   * management by WAF. </p><p><h3>See Also:</h3>   <a
