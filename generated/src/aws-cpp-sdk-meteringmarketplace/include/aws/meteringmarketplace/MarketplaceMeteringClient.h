   * <p>Paid container software products sold through Amazon Web Services Marketplace

   * metering. Free and BYOL products for Amazon ECS or Amazon EKS aren't required to
   * call <code>RegisterUsage</code>, but you may choose to do so if you would like
   * to receive usage data in your seller reports. The sections below explain the
   * behavior of <code>RegisterUsage</code>. <code>RegisterUsage</code> performs two
   * primary functions: metering and entitlement.</p> <ul> <li> <p>
   * <i>Entitlement</i>: <code>RegisterUsage</code> allows you to verify that the
   * customer running your paid software is subscribed to your product on Amazon Web
   * Services Marketplace, enabling you to guard against unauthorized use. Your
   * container image that integrates with <code>RegisterUsage</code> is only required
   * to guard against unauthorized use at container startup, as such a
   * <code>CustomerNotSubscribedException</code> or
   * <code>PlatformNotSupportedException</code> will only be thrown on the initial
   * call to <code>RegisterUsage</code>. Subsequent calls from the same Amazon ECS
   * task instance (e.g. task-id) or Amazon EKS pod will not throw a
   * <code>CustomerNotSubscribedException</code>, even if the customer unsubscribes
   * while the Amazon ECS task or Amazon EKS pod is still running.</p> </li> <li> <p>
   * <i>Metering</i>: <code>RegisterUsage</code> meters software use per ECS task,
   * per hour, or per pod for Amazon EKS with usage prorated to the second. A minimum
   * of 1 minute of usage applies to tasks that are short lived. For example, if a
   * customer has a 10 node Amazon ECS or Amazon EKS cluster and a service configured
   * as a Daemon Set, then Amazon ECS or Amazon EKS will launch a task on all 10
   * cluster nodes and the customer will be charged for 10 tasks. Software metering
   * is handled by the Amazon Web Services Marketplace metering control plane—your
   * software is not required to perform metering-specific actions other than to call
   * <code>RegisterUsage</code> to commence metering. The Amazon Web Services
   * Marketplace metering control plane will also bill customers for running ECS
   * tasks and Amazon EKS pods, regardless of the customer's subscription state,
   * which removes the need for your software to run entitlement checks at runtime.
   * For containers, <code>RegisterUsage</code> should be called immediately at
   * launch. If you don’t register the container within the first 6 hours of the
   * launch, Amazon Web Services Marketplace Metering Service doesn’t provide any
   * metering guarantees for previous months. Metering will continue, however, for
   * the current month forward until the container ends. <code>RegisterUsage</code>
   * is for metering paid hourly container products.</p> <p>For Amazon Web Services
   * Regions that support <code>RegisterUsage</code>, see <a
   * href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/marketplace/latest/APIReference/metering-regions.html#registerusage-region-support">RegisterUsage
