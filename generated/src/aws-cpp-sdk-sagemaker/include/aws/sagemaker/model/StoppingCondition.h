   * <p>Specifies a limit to how long a model training job or model compilation job
   * can run. It also specifies how long a managed spot training job has to complete.
   * When the job reaches the time limit, SageMaker ends the training or compilation
   * job. Use this API to cap model training costs.</p> <p>To stop a training job,
   * SageMaker sends the algorithm the <code>SIGTERM</code> signal, which delays job
   * termination for 120 seconds. Algorithms can use this 120-second window to save
   * the model artifacts, so the results of training are not lost. </p> <p>The
   * training algorithms provided by SageMaker automatically save the intermediate
   * results of a model training job when possible. This attempt to save artifacts is
   * only a best effort case as model might not be in a state from which it can be
   * saved. For example, if training has just started, the model might not be ready
   * to save. When saved, this intermediate data is a valid model artifact. You can
   * use it to create a model with <code>CreateModel</code>.</p>  <p>The Neural
   * Topic Model (NTM) currently does not support saving intermediate model
   * artifacts. When training NTMs, make sure that the maximum runtime is sufficient
   * for the training job to complete.</p> <p><h3>See Also:</h3>   <a
