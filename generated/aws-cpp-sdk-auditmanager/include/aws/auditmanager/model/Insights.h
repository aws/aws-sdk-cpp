   * <p>A summary of the latest analytics data for all your active assessments. </p>

   * following totals are daily counts based on this date — they aren’t a total sum
   * to date. </p> <p>The <code>Insights</code> data is eventually consistent. This
   * means that, when you read data from <code>Insights</code>, the response might
   * not instantly reflect the results of a recently completed write or update
   * operation. If you repeat your read request after a few hours, the response
   * should return the latest data.</p>  <p>If you delete an assessment or
   * change its status to inactive, <code>InsightsByAssessment</code> includes data
   * for that assessment as follows.</p> <ul> <li> <p> <b>Inactive assessments</b> -
   * If Audit Manager collected evidence for your assessment before you changed it
   * inactive, that evidence is included in the <code>InsightsByAssessment</code>
   * counts for that day.</p> </li> <li> <p> <b>Deleted assessments</b> - If Audit
   * Manager collected evidence for your assessment before you deleted it, that
   * evidence isn't included in the <code>InsightsByAssessment</code> counts for that
