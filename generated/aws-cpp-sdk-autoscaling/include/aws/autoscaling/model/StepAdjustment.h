   * metric is greater than or equal to 50 and less than 60, specify a lower bound of
   * 0 and an upper bound of 10.</p> </li> <li> <p>To trigger the adjustment when the
   * metric is greater than 40 and less than or equal to 50, specify a lower bound of
   * -10 and an upper bound of 0.</p> </li> </ul> <p>There are a few rules for the
   * step adjustments for your step policy:</p> <ul> <li> <p>The ranges of your step
   * adjustments can't overlap or have a gap.</p> </li> <li> <p>At most, one step
   * adjustment can have a null lower bound. If one step adjustment has a negative
   * lower bound, then there must be a step adjustment with a null lower bound.</p>
   * </li> <li> <p>At most, one step adjustment can have a null upper bound. If one
   * step adjustment has a positive upper bound, then there must be a step adjustment
   * with a null upper bound.</p> </li> <li> <p>The upper and lower bound can't be
