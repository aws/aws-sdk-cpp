# Breaking changes in AWS SDK for C++

## [1.4.0](https://github.com/aws/aws-sdk-cpp/tree/1.4.0) (2018-02-19)

### aws-cpp-sdk-s3

Fixed bug in Aws::S3::Model::CopyObjectResult, added CopyObjectResultDetails as a member of CopyObjectResult.

We were missing a member of CopyObjectResult because of name conflict and related files are overwritten when we generate the source code.

We renamed this member to CopyObjectResultDetails.

### aws-cpp-sdk-config

Removed unused enum values.

From the service release notes:
> AWS Config updated the ConfigurationItemStatus enum values. The values prior to this update did not represent appropriate values returned by GetResourceConfigHistory. You must update your code to enumerate the new enum values so this is a breaking change. To map old properties to new properties, use the following descriptions: New discovered resource - Old property: Discovered, New property: ResourceDiscovered. Updated resource - Old property: Ok, New property: OK. Deleted resource - Old property: Deleted, New property: ResourceDeleted or ResourceDeletedNotRecorded. Not-recorded resource - Old property: N/A, New property: ResourceNotRecorded or ResourceDeletedNotRecorded.




## [1.3.0](https://github.com/aws/aws-sdk-cpp/tree/1.3.0) (2017-11-09)

### aws-cpp-sdk-s3

Changed the constructor of AWSAuthV4Signer to use PayloadSigningPolicy instead of a boolean.


## [1.2.0](https://github.com/aws/aws-sdk-cpp/tree/1.2.0) (2017-09-24)

### aws-cpp-sdk-transfer

Changed ownership of thread executor in TransferManager.


## [1.1.1](https://github.com/aws/aws-sdk-cpp/tree/1.1.1) (2017-06-22)

### aws-cpp-sdk-transfer

Introduced a builder function to instantiate TransferManager
as a shared_ptr. That ensures that other threads can increase
TransferManager's lifetime until all the callbacks have finished.
