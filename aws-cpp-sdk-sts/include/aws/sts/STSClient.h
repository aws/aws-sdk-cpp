  /**
   * <fullname>AWS Security Token Service</fullname> <p>The AWS Security Token
   * Service (STS) is a web service that enables you to request temporary,
   * limited-privilege credentials for AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) users
   * or for users that you authenticate (federated users). This guide provides
   * descriptions of the STS API. For more detailed information about using this
   * service, go to <a
   * href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_credentials_temp.html">Temporary
   * Security Credentials</a>. </p> <note> <p> As an alternative to using the API,
   * you can use one of the AWS SDKs, which consist of libraries and sample code for
   * various programming languages and platforms (Java, Ruby, .NET, iOS, Android,
   * etc.). The SDKs provide a convenient way to create programmatic access to STS.
   * For example, the SDKs take care of cryptographically signing requests, managing
   * errors, and retrying requests automatically. For information about the AWS SDKs,
   * including how to download and install them, see the <a
   * href="http://aws.amazon.com/tools/">Tools for Amazon Web Services page</a>. </p>
   * </note> <p>For information about setting up signatures and authorization through
   * the API, go to <a
   * href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/signing_aws_api_requests.html">Signing
   * AWS API Requests</a> in the <i>AWS General Reference</i>. For general

   * </p> <p> <b>Endpoints</b> </p> <p>The AWS Security Token Service (STS) has a
   * default endpoint of https://sts.amazonaws.com that maps to the US East (N.
   * Virginia) region. Additional regions are available and are activated by default.
   * For more information, see <a

         * <p>Calling <code>AssumeRoleWithWebIdentity</code> does not require the use of
         * AWS security credentials. Therefore, you can distribute an application (for
         * example, on mobile devices) that requests temporary security credentials without
         * including long-term AWS credentials in the application, and without deploying
         * server-based proxy services that use long-term AWS credentials. Instead, the
         * identity of the caller is validated by using a token from the web identity
         * provider. For a comparison of <code>AssumeRoleWithWebIdentity</code> with the
         * other APIs that produce temporary credentials, see <a

         * parameter to specify the duration of your session. You can provide a value from
         * 900 seconds (15 minutes) up to the maximum session duration setting for the
         * role. This setting can have a value from 1 hour to 12 hours. To learn how to

         * <b>Permissions</b> </p> <p>The permissions for the temporary security

         * <code>GetFederationToken</code> API call--that is, to the <i>federated user</i>.
         * When the federated user makes an AWS request, AWS evaluates the policy attached
         * to the federated user in combination with the policy or policies attached to the
         * IAM user whose credentials were used to call <code>GetFederationToken</code>.
         * AWS allows the federated user's request only when both the federated user <i>
         * <b>and</b> </i> the IAM user are explicitly allowed to perform the requested
         * action. The passed policy cannot grant more permissions than those that are
         * defined in the IAM user policy.</p> <p>A typical use case is that the
         * permissions of the IAM user whose credentials are used to call
         * <code>GetFederationToken</code> are designed to allow access to all the actions
         * and resources that any federated user will need. Then, for individual users, you
         * pass a policy to the operation that scopes down the permissions to a level
         * that's appropriate to that individual user, using a policy that allows only a
         * subset of permissions that are granted to the IAM user. </p> <p>If you do not
         * pass a policy, the resulting temporary security credentials have no effective
         * permissions. The only exception is when the temporary security credentials are
         * used to access a resource that has a resource-based policy that specifically

         * <note> <p>We recommend that you do not call <code>GetSessionToken</code> with

         * href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/best-practices.html#create-iam-users">best
         * practices</a> by creating one or more IAM users, giving them the necessary

         * <p>The permissions associated with the temporary security credentials returned

         * temporary credentials have the same permissions as the IAM user. </p> <p>For
