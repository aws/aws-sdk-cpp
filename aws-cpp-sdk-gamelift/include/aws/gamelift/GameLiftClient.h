         * <p>Creates or updates a scaling policy for a fleet. Scaling policies are used to
         * automatically scale a fleet's hosting capacity to meet player demand. An active
         * scaling policy instructs Amazon GameLift to track a fleet metric and
         * automatically change the fleet's capacity when a certain threshold is reached.
         * There are two types of scaling policies: target-based and rule-based. Use a
         * target-based policy to quickly and efficiently manage fleet scaling; this option
         * is the most commonly used. Use rule-based policies when you need to exert
         * fine-grained control over auto-scaling. </p> <p>Fleets can have multiple scaling
         * policies of each type in force at the same time; you can have one target-based
         * policy, one or multiple rule-based scaling policies, or both. We recommend
         * caution, however, because multiple auto-scaling policies can have unintended
         * consequences.</p> <p>Learn more about how to work with auto-scaling in <a
         * href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/gamelift/latest/developerguide/fleets-autoscaling.html">Set
         * Up Fleet Automatic Scaling</a>.</p> <p> <b>Target-based policy</b> </p> <p>A
         * target-based policy tracks a single metric: PercentAvailableGameSessions. This
         * metric tells us how much of a fleet's hosting capacity is ready to host game
         * sessions but is not currently in use. This is the fleet's buffer; it measures
         * the additional player demand that the fleet could handle at current capacity.
         * With a target-based policy, you set your ideal buffer size and leave it to
         * Amazon GameLift to take whatever action is needed to maintain that target. </p>
         * <p>For example, you might choose to maintain a 10% buffer for a fleet that has
         * the capacity to host 100 simultaneous game sessions. This policy tells Amazon
         * GameLift to take action whenever the fleet's available capacity falls below or
         * rises above 10 game sessions. Amazon GameLift will start new instances or stop
         * unused instances in order to return to the 10% buffer. </p> <p>To create or
         * update a target-based policy, specify a fleet ID and name, and set the policy
         * type to "TargetBased". Specify the metric to track
         * (PercentAvailableGameSessions) and reference a <code>TargetConfiguration</code>
         * object with your desired buffer value. Exclude all other parameters. On a
         * successful request, the policy name is returned. The scaling policy is
         * automatically in force as soon as it's successfully created. If the fleet's
         * auto-scaling actions are temporarily suspended, the new policy will be in force
         * once the fleet actions are restarted.</p> <p> <b>Rule-based policy</b> </p> <p>A
         * rule-based policy tracks specified fleet metric, sets a threshold value, and
         * specifies the type of action to initiate when triggered. With a rule-based
         * policy, you can select from several available fleet metrics. Each policy
         * specifies whether to scale up or scale down (and by how much), so you need one
         * policy for each type of action. </p> <p>For example, a policy may make the
         * following statement: "If the percentage of idle instances is greater than 20%
         * for more than 15 minutes, then reduce the fleet capacity by 10%."</p> <p>A
         * policy's rule statement has the following structure:</p> <p>If
         * <code>[MetricName]</code> is <code>[ComparisonOperator]</code>
         * <code>[Threshold]</code> for <code>[EvaluationPeriods]</code> minutes, then
         * <code>[ScalingAdjustmentType]</code> to/by <code>[ScalingAdjustment]</code>.</p>
         * <p>To implement the example, the rule statement would look like this:</p> <p>If
         * <code>[PercentIdleInstances]</code> is <code>[GreaterThanThreshold]</code>
         * <code>[20]</code> for <code>[15]</code> minutes, then
         * <code>[PercentChangeInCapacity]</code> to/by <code>[10]</code>.</p> <p>To create
         * or update a scaling policy, specify a unique combination of name and fleet ID,
         * and set the policy type to "RuleBased". Specify the parameter values for a
         * policy rule statement. On a successful request, the policy name is returned.
         * Scaling policies are automatically in force as soon as they're successfully
         * created. If the fleet's auto-scaling actions are temporarily suspended, the new
         * policy will be in force once the fleet actions are restarted.</p><p><h3>See

         * (such as a UUID) for the placement. You use this ID to track the status of the

         * player ID for each player that you are joining to the new game session (player
         * data is optional, but if you include it, you must also provide a unique ID for
         * each player)</p> </li> <li> <p>Latency data for all players (if you want to
         * optimize game play for the players)</p> </li> </ul> <p>If successful, a new game
