  /**
   * <fullname>Amazon GameLift Service</fullname> <p>Welcome to the <i>Amazon
   * GameLift API Reference</i>. Amazon GameLift is a managed Amazon Web Services
   * (AWS) service for developers who need a scalable, server-based solution for
   * multiplayer games. Amazon GameLift provides setup and deployment of game
   * servers, and handles infrastructure scaling and session management. For more
   * information about the GameLift service, including a feature overview, getting
   * started guide, and tutorial, see the accompanying <a
   * href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/gamelift/latest/developerguide/">Amazon
   * GameLift Developer Guide</a>.</p> <p>This reference describes the low-level
   * service API for GameLift. You can call this API directly or use the <a
   * href="https://aws.amazon.com/tools/">AWS SDK</a> for your preferred language.
   * The AWS SDK includes a set of high-level GameLift actions multiplayer game
   * sessions. Alternatively, you can use the <a
   * href="https://aws.amazon.com/cli/">AWS command-line interface</a> (CLI) tool,
   * which includes commands for GameLift. For administrative actions, you can use
   * the Amazon GameLift console. </p> <p><b>Managing Game and Player Sessions
