     * Fleet status changed from <code>NEW</code> to <code>DOWNLOADING</code>. The
     * compressed build has started downloading to a fleet instance for
     * installation.</p> </li> <li> <p> FLEET_BINARY_DOWNLOAD_FAILED -- The build
     * failed to download to the fleet instance.</p> </li> <li>
     * <p>FLEET_CREATION_EXTRACTING_BUILD – The game server build was successfully
     * downloaded to an instance, and the build files are now being extracted from the
     * uploaded build and saved to an instance. Failure at this stage prevents a fleet
     * from moving to <code>ACTIVE</code> status. Logs for this stage display a list of
     * the files that are extracted and saved on the instance. Access the logs by using
     * the URL in <i>PreSignedLogUrl</i>.</p> </li> <li>
     * <p>FLEET_CREATION_RUNNING_INSTALLER – The game server build files were
     * successfully extracted, and the Amazon GameLift is now running the build's
     * install script (if one is included). Failure in this stage prevents a fleet from
     * moving to <code>ACTIVE</code> status. Logs for this stage list the installation
     * steps and whether or not the install completed successfully. Access the logs by
     * using the URL in <i>PreSignedLogUrl</i>. </p> </li> <li>
     * <p>FLEET_CREATION_VALIDATING_RUNTIME_CONFIG -- The build process was successful,
     * and the Amazon GameLift is now verifying that the game server launch paths,
     * which are specified in the fleet's run-time configuration, exist. If any listed
     * launch path exists, Amazon GameLift tries to launch a game server process and
     * waits for the process to report ready. Failures in this stage prevent a fleet
     * from moving to <code>ACTIVE</code> status. Logs for this stage list the launch
     * paths in the run-time configuration and indicate whether each is found. Access
     * the logs by using the URL in <i>PreSignedLogUrl</i>. </p> </li> <li>
     * <p>FLEET_STATE_VALIDATING -- Fleet status changed from <code>DOWNLOADING</code>
     * to <code>VALIDATING</code>.</p> </li> <li> <p>
     * FLEET_VALIDATION_LAUNCH_PATH_NOT_FOUND -- Validation of the run-time
     * configuration failed because the executable specified in a launch path does not
     * exist on the instance.</p> </li> <li> <p>FLEET_STATE_BUILDING -- Fleet status
     * changed from <code>VALIDATING</code> to <code>BUILDING</code>.</p> </li> <li>
     * <p>FLEET_VALIDATION_EXECUTABLE_RUNTIME_FAILURE -- Validation of the run-time
     * configuration failed because the executable specified in a launch path failed to
     * run on the fleet instance.</p> </li> <li> <p>FLEET_STATE_ACTIVATING -- Fleet
     * status changed from <code>BUILDING</code> to <code>ACTIVATING</code>. </p> </li>
     * <li> <p> FLEET_ACTIVATION_FAILED - The fleet failed to successfully complete one
     * of the steps in the fleet activation process. This event code indicates that the
     * game build was successfully downloaded to a fleet instance, built, and
     * validated, but was not able to start a server process. A possible reason for
     * failure is that the game server is not reporting "process ready" to the Amazon
     * GameLift service.</p> </li> <li> <p>FLEET_STATE_ACTIVE -- The fleet's status
