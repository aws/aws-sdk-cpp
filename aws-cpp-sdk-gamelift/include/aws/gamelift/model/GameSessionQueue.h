   * <p>Configuration of a queue that is used to process game session placement
   * requests. The queue configuration identifies several game features:</p> <ul>
   * <li> <p>The destinations where a new game session can potentially be hosted.
   * Amazon GameLift tries these destinations in an order based on either the queue's
   * default order or player latency information, if provided in a placement request.
   * With latency information, Amazon GameLift can place game sessions where the
   * majority of players are reporting the lowest possible latency. </p> </li> <li>
   * <p>The length of time that placement requests can wait in the queue before
   * timing out. </p> </li> <li> <p>A set of optional latency policies that protect
   * individual players from high latencies, preventing game sessions from being
   * placed where any individual player is reporting latency higher than a policy's
   * maximum.</p> </li> </ul> <p>Queue-related operations include:</p> <ul> <li> <p>
