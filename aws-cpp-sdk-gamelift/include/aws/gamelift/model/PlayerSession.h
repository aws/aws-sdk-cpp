  /**
   * <p>Properties describing a player session. Player session objects are created
   * either by creating a player session for a specific game session, or as part of a
   * game session placement. A player session represents either a player reservation
   * for a game session (status <code>RESERVED</code>) or actual player activity in a
   * game session (status <code>ACTIVE</code>). A player session object (including
   * player data) is automatically passed to a game session when the player connects
   * to the game session and is validated.</p> <p>When a player disconnects, the
   * player session status changes to <code>COMPLETED</code>. Once the session ends,
   * the player session object is retained for 30 days and then removed.</p>
   * <p>Player-session-related operations include:</p> <ul> <li> <p>
