   * <p>Custom prioritization settings for use by a game session queue when placing
   * new game sessions with available game servers. When defined, this configuration
   * replaces the default FleetIQ prioritization process, which is as follows:</p>
   * <ul> <li> <p>If player latency data is included in a game session request,
   * destinations and locations are prioritized first based on lowest average latency
   * (1), then on lowest hosting cost (2), then on destination list order (3), and
   * finally on location (alphabetical) (4). This approach ensures that the queue's
   * top priority is to place game sessions where average player latency is lowest,
   * and--if latency is the same--where the hosting cost is less, etc.</p> </li> <li>
   * <p>If player latency data is not included, destinations and locations are
   * prioritized first on destination list order (1), and then on location
   * (alphabetical) (2). This approach ensures that the queue's top priority is to
   * place game sessions on the first destination fleet listed. If that fleet has
   * multiple locations, the game session is placed on the first location (when
   * listed alphabetically).</p> </li> </ul> <p>Changing the priority order will
   * affect how game sessions are placed.</p><p><h3>See Also:</h3>   <a
