  /**
   * <p>Amazon CloudWatch Events helps you to respond to state changes in your AWS
   * resources. When your resources change state they automatically send events into
   * an event stream. You can create rules that match selected events in the stream
   * and route them to targets to take action. You can also use rules to take action
   * on a pre-determined schedule. For example, you can configure rules to: </p> <ul>
   * <li>Automatically invoke an AWS Lambda function to update DNS entries when an
   * event notifies you that Amazon EC2 instance enters the running state.</li>
   * <li>Direct specific API records from CloudTrail to an Amazon Kinesis stream for
   * detailed analysis of potential security or availability risks.</li>
   * <li>Periodically invoke a built-in target to create a snapshot of an Amazon EBS
   * volume.</li> </ul> <p> For more information about Amazon CloudWatch Events
   * features, see the <a
