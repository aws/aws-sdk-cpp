  /**
   * <fullname>AWS Organizations API Reference</fullname> <p>AWS Organizations is a
   * web service that enables you to consolidate your multiple AWS accounts into an
   * <i>organization</i> and centrally manage your accounts and their resources.</p>
   * <p>This guide provides descriptions of the Organizations API. For more
   * information about using this service, see the <a
   * href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/organizations/latest/userguide/orgs_introduction.html">AWS
   * Organizations User Guide</a>.</p> <p> <b>API Version</b> </p> <p>This version of
   * the Organizations API Reference documents the Organizations API version
   * 2016-11-28.</p> <note> <p>As an alternative to using the API directly, you can
   * use one of the AWS SDKs, which consist of libraries and sample code for various
   * programming languages and platforms (Java, Ruby, .NET, iOS, Android, and more).
   * The SDKs provide a convenient way to create programmatic access to AWS
   * Organizations. For example, the SDKs take care of cryptographically signing
   * requests, managing errors, and retrying requests automatically. For more
   * information about the AWS SDKs, including how to download and install them, see
   * <a href="http://aws.amazon.com/tools/">Tools for Amazon Web Services</a>.</p>
   * </note> <p>We recommend that you use the AWS SDKs to make programmatic API calls
   * to Organizations. However, you also can use the Organizations Query API to make
   * direct calls to the Organizations web service. To learn more about the
   * Organizations Query API, see <a
   * href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/organizations/latest/userguide/orgs_query-requests.html">Making
   * Query Requests</a> in the <i>AWS Organizations User Guide</i>. Organizations
   * supports GET and POST requests for all actions. That is, the API does not
   * require you to use GET for some actions and POST for others. However, GET
   * requests are subject to the limitation size of a URL. Therefore, for operations
   * that require larger sizes, use a POST request.</p> <p> <b>Signing Requests</b>
   * </p> <p>When you send HTTP requests to AWS, you must sign the requests so that
   * AWS can identify who sent them. You sign requests with your AWS access key,
   * which consists of an access key ID and a secret access key. We strongly
   * recommend that you do not create an access key for your root account. Anyone who
   * has the access key for your root account has unrestricted access to all the
   * resources in your account. Instead, create an access key for an IAM user account
   * that has administrative privileges. As another option, use AWS Security Token
   * Service to generate temporary security credentials, and use those credentials to
   * sign requests. </p> <p>To sign requests, we recommend that you use <a
   * href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/signature-version-4.html">Signature
   * Version 4</a>. If you have an existing application that uses Signature Version
   * 2, you do not have to update it to use Signature Version 4. However, some
   * operations now require Signature Version 4. The documentation for operations
   * that require version 4 indicate this requirement. </p> <p>When you use the AWS
   * Command Line Interface (AWS CLI) or one of the AWS SDKs to make requests to AWS,
   * these tools automatically sign the requests for you with the access key that you
   * specify when you configure the tools.</p> <p>In this release, each organization
   * can have only one root. In a future release, a single organization will support
   * multiple roots.</p> <p> <b>Support and Feedback for AWS Organizations</b> </p>
   * <p>We welcome your feedback. Send your comments to <a
   * href="mailto:feedback-awsorganizations@amazon.com">feedback-awsorganizations@amazon.com</a>
   * or post your feedback and questions in the <a
   * href="http://forums.aws.amazon.com/forum.jspa?forumID=219">AWS Organizations
   * support forum</a>. For more information about the AWS support forums, see <a
   * href="http://forums.aws.amazon.com/help.jspa">Forums Help</a>.</p> <p>
   * <b>Endpoint to Call When Using the CLI or the AWS API</b> </p> <p>For the
   * current release of Organizations, you must specify the <code>us-east-1</code>
   * region for all AWS API and CLI calls. You can do this in the CLI by using these
   * parameters and commands:</p> <ul> <li> <p>Use the following parameter with each
   * command to specify both the endpoint and its region:</p> <p>
   * <code>--endpoint-url https://organizations.us-east-1.amazonaws.com</code> </p>
   * </li> <li> <p>Use the default endpoint, but configure your default region with
   * this command:</p> <p> <code>aws configure set default.region us-east-1</code>
   * </p> </li> <li> <p>Use the following parameter with each command to specify the
   * endpoint:</p> <p> <code>--region us-east-1</code> </p> </li> </ul> <p>For the
   * various SDKs used to call the APIs, see the documentation for the SDK of
   * interest to learn how to direct the requests to a specific endpoint. For more
   * information, see <a
   * href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/rande.html#sts_region">Regions
   * and Endpoints</a> in the <i>AWS General Reference</i>. </p> <p> <b>How examples
   * are presented</b> </p> <p>The JSON returned by the AWS Organizations service as
   * response to your requests is returned as a single long string without line
   * breaks or formatting whitespace. Both line breaks and whitespace are included in
   * the examples in this guide to improve readability. When example input parameters
