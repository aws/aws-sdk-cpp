         * portion of the shard that the iterator points to, <a>GetRecords</a> returns an
         * empty list. It might take multiple calls to get to a portion of the shard that
         * contains records.</p> <p>You can scale by provisioning multiple shards per
         * stream while considering service limits (for more information, see <a
         * href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kinesis/latest/dev/service-sizes-and-limits.html">Amazon
         * Kinesis Data Streams Limits</a> in the <i>Amazon Kinesis Data Streams Developer
         * Guide</i>). Your application should have one thread per shard, each reading
         * continuously from its stream. To read from a stream continually, call
         * <a>GetRecords</a> in a loop. Use <a>GetShardIterator</a> to get the shard
         * iterator to specify in the first <a>GetRecords</a> call. <a>GetRecords</a>
         * returns a new shard iterator in <code>NextShardIterator</code>. Specify the
         * shard iterator returned in <code>NextShardIterator</code> in subsequent calls to
         * <a>GetRecords</a>. If the shard has been closed, the shard iterator can't return
         * more data and <a>GetRecords</a> returns <code>null</code> in
         * <code>NextShardIterator</code>. You can terminate the loop when the shard is
         * closed, or when the shard iterator reaches the record with the sequence number
         * or other attribute that marks it as the last record to process.</p> <p>Each data
         * record can be up to 1 MiB in size, and each shard can read up to 2 MiB per
         * second. You can ensure that your calls don't exceed the maximum supported size
         * or throughput by using the <code>Limit</code> parameter to specify the maximum
         * number of records that <a>GetRecords</a> can return. Consider your average
         * record size when determining this limit. The maximum number of records that can
         * be returned per call is 10,000.</p> <p>The size of the data returned by
         * <a>GetRecords</a> varies depending on the utilization of the shard. It is
         * recommended that consumer applications retrieve records via the
         * <code>GetRecords</code> command using the 5 TPS limit to remain caught up.
         * Retrieving records less frequently can lead to consumer applications falling
         * behind. The maximum size of data that <a>GetRecords</a> can return is 10 MiB. If
         * a call returns this amount of data, subsequent calls made within the next 5
         * seconds throw <code>ProvisionedThroughputExceededException</code>. If there is
         * insufficient provisioned throughput on the stream, subsequent calls made within
         * the next 1 second throw <code>ProvisionedThroughputExceededException</code>.
         * <a>GetRecords</a> doesn't return any data when it throws an exception. For this
         * reason, we recommend that you wait 1 second between calls to <a>GetRecords</a>.
         * However, it's possible that the application will get exceptions for longer than
         * 1 second.</p> <p>To detect whether the application is falling behind in
         * processing, you can use the <code>MillisBehindLatest</code> response attribute.
         * You can also monitor the stream using CloudWatch metrics and other mechanisms
         * (see <a
         * href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kinesis/latest/dev/monitoring.html">Monitoring</a>
         * in the <i>Amazon Kinesis Data Streams Developer Guide</i>).</p> <p>Each Amazon
         * Kinesis record includes a value, <code>ApproximateArrivalTimestamp</code>, that
         * is set when a stream successfully receives and stores a record. This is commonly
         * referred to as a server-side time stamp, whereas a client-side time stamp is set
         * when a data producer creates or sends the record to a stream (a data producer is
         * any data source putting data records into a stream, for example with
         * <a>PutRecords</a>). The time stamp has millisecond precision. There are no
         * guarantees about the time stamp accuracy, or that the time stamp is always
         * increasing. For example, records in a shard or across a stream might have time
         * stamps that are out of order.</p> <p>This operation has a limit of five

         * <p>This operation establishes an HTTP/2 connection between the consumer you
         * specify in the <code>ConsumerARN</code> parameter and the shard you specify in
         * the <code>ShardId</code> parameter. After the connection is successfully
         * established, Kinesis Data Streams pushes records from the shard to the consumer
         * over this connection. Before you call this operation, call
         * <a>RegisterStreamConsumer</a> to register the consumer with Kinesis Data
         * Streams.</p> <p>When the <code>SubscribeToShard</code> call succeeds, your
         * consumer starts receiving events of type <a>SubscribeToShardEvent</a> over the
         * HTTP/2 connection for up to 5 minutes, after which time you need to call
         * <code>SubscribeToShard</code> again to renew the subscription if you want to
         * continue to receive records.</p> <p>You can make one call to
         * <code>SubscribeToShard</code> per second per registered consumer per shard. For
         * example, if you have a 4000 shard stream and two registered stream consumers,
         * you can make one <code>SubscribeToShard</code> request per second for each
         * combination of shard and registered consumer, allowing you to subscribe both
         * consumers to all 4000 shards in one second. </p> <p>If you call
         * <code>SubscribeToShard</code> again with the same <code>ConsumerARN</code> and
         * <code>ShardId</code> within 5 seconds of a successful call, you'll get a
         * <code>ResourceInUseException</code>. If you call <code>SubscribeToShard</code> 5
         * seconds or more after a successful call, the second call takes over the
         * subscription and the previous connection expires or fails with a
         * <code>ResourceInUseException</code>.</p> <p>For an example of how to use this
         * operations, see <a

         * specify a target that isn't a multiple of 25%, the scaling action might take
         * longer to complete. </p> <p>This operation has the following default limits. By
         * default, you cannot do the following:</p> <ul> <li> <p>Scale more than ten times
         * per rolling 24-hour period per stream</p> </li> <li> <p>Scale up to more than
         * double your current shard count for a stream</p> </li> <li> <p>Scale down below
         * half your current shard count for a stream</p> </li> <li> <p>Scale up to more
         * than 10000 shards in a stream</p> </li> <li> <p>Scale a stream with more than
         * 10000 shards down unless the result is less than 10000 shards</p> </li> <li>
         * <p>Scale up to more than the shard limit for your account</p> </li> </ul> <p>For
