   * <p>Specifies a limit to how long a model training job, model compilation job, or
   * hyperparameter tuning job can run. It also specifies how long a managed Spot
   * training job has to complete. When the job reaches the time limit, Amazon
   * SageMaker ends the training or compilation job. Use this API to cap model
   * training costs.</p> <p>To stop a training job, Amazon SageMaker sends the
   * algorithm the <code>SIGTERM</code> signal, which delays job termination for 120
   * seconds. Algorithms can use this 120-second window to save the model artifacts,
   * so the results of training are not lost. </p> <p>The training algorithms
   * provided by Amazon SageMaker automatically save the intermediate results of a
   * model training job when possible. This attempt to save artifacts is only a best
   * effort case as model might not be in a state from which it can be saved. For
   * example, if training has just started, the model might not be ready to save.
   * When saved, this intermediate data is a valid model artifact. You can use it to
   * create a model with <code>CreateModel</code>.</p>  <p>The Neural Topic
   * Model (NTM) currently does not support saving intermediate model artifacts. When
   * training NTMs, make sure that the maximum runtime is sufficient for the training
   * job to complete.</p> <p><h3>See Also:</h3>   <a
