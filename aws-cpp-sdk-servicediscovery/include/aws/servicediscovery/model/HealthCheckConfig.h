  /**
   * <p> <i>Public DNS namespaces only.</i> A complex type that contains settings for
   * an optional health check. If you specify settings for a health check, Amazon
   * Route 53 associates the health check with all the records that you specify in
   * <code>DnsConfig</code>.</p> <p> <b>A and AAAA records</b> </p> <p>If
   * <code>DnsConfig</code> includes configurations for both A and AAAA records,
   * Route 53 creates a health check that uses the IPv4 address to check the health
   * of the resource. If the endpoint that is specified by the IPv4 address is
   * unhealthy, Route 53 considers both the A and AAAA records to be unhealthy. </p>
   * <p> <b>CNAME records</b> </p> <p>You can't specify settings for
   * <code>HealthCheckConfig</code> when the <code>DNSConfig</code> includes
   * <code>CNAME</code> for the value of <code>Type</code>. If you do, the
   * <code>CreateService</code> request will fail with an <code>InvalidInput</code>
   * error.</p> <p> <b>Request interval</b> </p> <p>The health check uses 30 seconds
   * as the request interval. This is the number of seconds between the time that
   * each Route 53 health checker gets a response from your endpoint and the time
   * that it sends the next health check request. A health checker in each data
   * center around the world sends your endpoint a health check request every 30
   * seconds. On average, your endpoint receives a health check request about every
   * two seconds. Health checkers in different data centers don't coordinate with one
   * another, so you'll sometimes see several requests per second followed by a few
   * seconds with no health checks at all.</p> <p> <b>Health checking regions</b>
   * </p> <p>Health checkers perform checks from all Route 53 health-checking
   * regions. For a list of the current regions, see <a
   * href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/APIReference/API_HealthCheckConfig.html#Route53-Type-HealthCheckConfig-Regions">Regions</a>.</p>
   * <p> <b>Alias records</b> </p> <p>When you register an instance, if you include
   * the <code>AWS_ALIAS_DNS_NAME</code> attribute, Route 53 creates an alias record.
   * Note the following:</p> <ul> <li> <p>Route 53 automatically sets
   * <code>EvaluateTargetHealth</code> to true for alias records. When
   * <code>EvaluateTargetHealth</code> is true, the alias record inherits the health
   * of the referenced AWS resource. such as an ELB load balancer. For more
   * information, see <a
   * href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/APIReference/API_AliasTarget.html#Route53-Type-AliasTarget-EvaluateTargetHealth">EvaluateTargetHealth</a>.</p>
   * </li> <li> <p>If you include <code>HealthCheckConfig</code> and then use the
   * service to register an instance that creates an alias record, Route 53 doesn't
   * create the health check.</p> </li> </ul> <p>For information about the charges
   * for health checks, see <a href="http://aws.amazon.com/route53/pricing">Route 53
   * Pricing</a>.</p><p><h3>See Also:</h3>   <a
