     * <p>The customer master key that Amazon SES should use to encrypt your emails
     * before saving them to the Amazon S3 bucket. You can use the default master key
     * or a custom master key you created in AWS KMS as follows:</p> <ul> <li> <p>To
     * use the default master key, provide an ARN in the form of
     * <code>arn:aws:kms:REGION:ACCOUNT-ID-WITHOUT-HYPHENS:alias/aws/ses</code>. For
     * example, if your AWS account ID is 123456789012 and you want to use the default
     * master key in the US West (Oregon) region, the ARN of the default master key
     * would be <code>arn:aws:kms:us-west-2:123456789012:alias/aws/ses</code>. If you
     * use the default master key, you don't need to perform any extra steps to give
     * Amazon SES permission to use the key.</p> </li> <li> <p>To use a custom master
     * key you created in AWS KMS, provide the ARN of the master key and ensure that
     * you add a statement to your key's policy to give Amazon SES permission to use
     * it. For more information about giving permissions, see the <a
     * href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/ses/latest/DeveloperGuide/receiving-email-permissions.html">Amazon
