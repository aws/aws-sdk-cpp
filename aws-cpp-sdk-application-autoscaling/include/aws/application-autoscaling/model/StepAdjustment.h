   * <p>Represents a step adjustment for a <a
   * href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/autoscaling/application/APIReference/API_StepScalingPolicyConfiguration.html">StepScalingPolicyConfiguration</a>.
   * Describes an adjustment based on the difference between the value of the
   * aggregated CloudWatch metric and the breach threshold that you've defined for
   * the alarm. </p> <p>For the following examples, suppose that you have an alarm
   * with a breach threshold of 50:</p> <ul> <li> <p>To trigger the adjustment when
   * the metric is greater than or equal to 50 and less than 60, specify a lower
   * bound of 0 and an upper bound of 10.</p> </li> <li> <p>To trigger the adjustment
   * when the metric is greater than 40 and less than or equal to 50, specify a lower
   * bound of -10 and an upper bound of 0.</p> </li> </ul> <p>There are a few rules
   * for the step adjustments for your step policy:</p> <ul> <li> <p>The ranges of
   * your step adjustments can't overlap or have a gap.</p> </li> <li> <p>At most one
   * step adjustment can have a null lower bound. If one step adjustment has a
   * negative lower bound, then there must be a step adjustment with a null lower
   * bound.</p> </li> <li> <p>At most one step adjustment can have a null upper
   * bound. If one step adjustment has a positive upper bound, then there must be a
   * step adjustment with a null upper bound.</p> </li> <li> <p>The upper and lower
   * bound can't be null in the same step adjustment.</p> </li> </ul><p><h3>See
