     * <code>80</code> for <code>Port</code> and <code>HTTP</code> or
     * <code>HTTP_STR_MATCH</code> for <code>Type</code>, Amazon Route 53 passes the
     * value of <code>FullyQualifiedDomainName</code> to the endpoint in the
     * <code>Host</code> header.</p> </li> <li> <p>If you specify a value of
     * <code>443</code> for <code>Port</code> and <code>HTTPS</code> or
     * <code>HTTPS_STR_MATCH</code> for <code>Type</code>, Amazon Route 53 passes the
     * value of <code>FullyQualifiedDomainName</code> to the endpoint in the Host
     * header.</p> </li> <li> <p>If you specify another value for <code>Port</code> and
     * any value except <code>TCP</code> for <code>Type</code>, Amazon Route 53 passes
     * <i> <code>FullyQualifiedDomainName</code>:<code>Port</code> </i> to the endpoint
     * in the Host header.</p> </li> </ul> <p>If you don't specify a value for
     * <code>FullyQualifiedDomainName</code>, Amazon Route 53 substitutes the value of
     * <code>IPAddress</code> in the <code>Host</code> header in each of the above
     * cases.</p> <p> <b>If you don't specify</b> <code>IPAddress</code>:</p> <p>If you
     * don't specify a value for <code>IPAddress</code>, Amazon Route 53 sends a DNS
     * request to the domain that you specify in <code>FullyQualifiedDomainName</code>
     * at the interval you specify in <code>RequestInterval</code>. Using an IP address
     * that DNS returns, Amazon Route 53 then checks the health of the endpoint.</p>
     * <p>If you want to check the health of weighted, latency, or failover resource
     * record sets and you choose to specify the endpoint only by
     * <code>FullyQualifiedDomainName</code>, we recommend that you create a separate
     * health check for each endpoint. For example, create a health check for each HTTP
     * server that is serving content for www.example.com. For the value of
     * <code>FullyQualifiedDomainName</code>, specify the domain name of the server
     * (such as <code>us-east-1-www.example.com</code>), not the name of the resource
     * record sets (www.example.com).</p> <important> <p>In this configuration, if the
     * value of <code>FullyQualifiedDomainName</code> matches the name of the resource
     * record sets and you then associate the health check with those resource record
     * sets, health check results will be unpredictable.</p> </important> <p>In
     * addition, if the value of <code>Type</code> is <code>HTTP</code>,
     * <code>HTTPS</code>, <code>HTTP_STR_MATCH</code>, or
     * <code>HTTPS_STR_MATCH</code>, Amazon Route 53 passes the value of
     * <code>FullyQualifiedDomainName</code> in the <code>Host</code> header, as it
     * does when you specify a value for <code>IPAddress</code>. If the value of
     * <code>Type</code> is <code>TCP</code>, Amazon Route 53 doesn't pass a
     * <code>Host</code> header.</p>
