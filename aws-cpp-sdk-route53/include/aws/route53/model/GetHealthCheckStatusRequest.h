     * <p>If you want Amazon Route 53 to return this resource record set in response to
     * a DNS query only when a health check is passing, include the
     * <code>HealthCheckId</code> element and specify the ID of the applicable health
     * check.</p> <p>Amazon Route 53 determines whether a resource record set is
     * healthy by periodically sending a request to the endpoint that is specified in
     * the health check. If that endpoint returns an HTTP status code of 2xx or 3xx,
     * the endpoint is healthy. If the endpoint returns an HTTP status code of 400 or
     * greater, or if the endpoint doesn't respond for a certain amount of time, Amazon
     * Route 53 considers the endpoint unhealthy and also considers the resource record
     * set unhealthy.</p> <p>The <code>HealthCheckId</code> element is only useful when
     * Amazon Route 53 is choosing between two or more resource record sets to respond
     * to a DNS query, and you want Amazon Route 53 to base the choice in part on the
     * status of a health check. Configuring health checks only makes sense in the
     * following configurations:</p> <ul> <li> <p>You're checking the health of the
     * resource record sets in a weighted, latency, geolocation, or failover resource
     * record set, and you specify health check IDs for all of the resource record
     * sets. If the health check for one resource record set specifies an endpoint that
     * is not healthy, Amazon Route 53 stops responding to queries using the value for
     * that resource record set.</p> </li> <li> <p>You set
     * <code>EvaluateTargetHealth</code> to <code>true</code> for the resource record
     * sets in an alias, weighted alias, latency alias, geolocation alias, or failover
     * alias resource record set, and you specify health check IDs for all of the
     * resource record sets that are referenced by the alias resource record sets. For
     * more information about this configuration, see
     * <code>EvaluateTargetHealth</code>.</p> <p>Amazon Route 53 doesn't check the
     * health of the endpoint specified in the resource record set, for example, the
     * endpoint specified by the IP address in the <code>Value</code> element. When you
     * add a <code>HealthCheckId</code> element to a resource record set, Amazon Route
     * 53 checks the health of the endpoint that you specified in the health check.</p>
     * </li> </ul> <p>For geolocation resource record sets, if an endpoint is
     * unhealthy, Amazon Route 53 looks for a resource record set for the larger,
     * associated geographic region. For example, suppose you have resource record sets
     * for a state in the United States, for the United States, for North America, and
     * for all locations. If the endpoint for the state resource record set is
     * unhealthy, Amazon Route 53 checks the resource record sets for the United
     * States, for North America, and for all locations (a resource record set for
     * which the value of CountryCode is <code>*</code>), in that order, until it finds
     * a resource record set for which the endpoint is healthy.</p> <p>If your health
     * checks specify the endpoint only by domain name, we recommend that you create a
     * separate health check for each endpoint. For example, create a health check for
     * each HTTP server that is serving content for www.example.com. For the value of
     * <code>FullyQualifiedDomainName</code>, specify the domain name of the server
     * (such as <code>us-east-1-www.example.com</code>), not the name of the resource
     * record sets (example.com).</p> <important> <p>In this configuration, if you
     * create a health check for which the value of
     * <code>FullyQualifiedDomainName</code> matches the name of the resource record
     * sets and then associate the health check with those resource record sets, health

     * associated geographic region. For example, suppose you have resource record sets
     * for a state in the United States, for the United States, for North America, and
     * for all locations. If the endpoint for the state resource record set is
     * unhealthy, Amazon Route 53 checks the resource record sets for the United
     * States, for North America, and for all locations (a resource record set for
     * which the value of CountryCode is <code>*</code>), in that order, until it finds
     * a resource record set for which the endpoint is healthy.</p> <p>If your health
     * checks specify the endpoint only by domain name, we recommend that you create a
     * separate health check for each endpoint. For example, create a health check for
     * each HTTP server that is serving content for www.example.com. For the value of
     * <code>FullyQualifiedDomainName</code>, specify the domain name of the server
     * (such as <code>us-east-1-www.example.com</code>), not the name of the resource
     * record sets (example.com).</p> <important> <p>In this configuration, if you
     * create a health check for which the value of
     * <code>FullyQualifiedDomainName</code> matches the name of the resource record
     * sets and then associate the health check with those resource record sets, health
     * check results will be unpredictable.</p> </important>
