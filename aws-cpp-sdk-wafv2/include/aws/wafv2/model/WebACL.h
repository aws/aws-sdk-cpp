   * <p> A Web ACL defines a collection of rules to use to inspect and control web
   * requests. Each rule has an action defined (allow, block, or count) for requests
   * that match the statement of the rule. In the Web ACL, you assign a default
   * action to take (allow, block) for any request that does not match any of the
   * rules. The rules in a Web ACL can be a combination of the types <a>Rule</a>,
   * <a>RuleGroup</a>, and managed rule group. You can associate a Web ACL with one
   * or more AWS resources to protect. The resources can be Amazon CloudFront, an
