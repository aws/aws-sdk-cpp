   * <p>A rate-based rule tracks the rate of requests for each originating IP
   * address, and triggers the rule action when the rate exceeds a limit that you
   * specify on the number of requests in any 5-minute time span. You can use this to
   * put a temporary block on requests from an IP address that is sending excessive
   * requests.</p> <p>When the rule action triggers, AWS WAF blocks additional
   * requests from the IP address until the request rate falls below the limit.</p>
   * <p>You can optionally nest another statement inside the rate-based statement, to
   * narrow the scope of the rule so that it only counts requests that match the
   * nested statement. For example, based on recent requests that you have seen from
   * an attacker, you might create a rate-based rule with a nested AND rule statement
   * that contains the following nested statements:</p> <ul> <li> <p>An IP match
   * statement with an IP set that specified the address 192.0.2.44.</p> </li> <li>
   * <p>A string match statement that searches in the User-Agent header for the
   * string BadBot.</p> </li> </ul> <p>In this rate-based rule, you also define a
   * rate limit. For this example, the rate limit is 1,000. Requests that meet both
   * of the conditions in the statements are counted. If the count exceeds 1,000
   * requests per five minutes, the rule action triggers. Requests that do not meet
   * both conditions are not counted towards the rate limit and are not affected by
   * this rule.</p> <p>You cannot nest a <code>RateBasedStatement</code>, for example
   * for use inside a <code>NotStatement</code> or <code>OrStatement</code>. It can
   * only be referenced as a top-level statement within a rule.</p><p><h3>See
