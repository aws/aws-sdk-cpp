  /**
   * <p>A rate-based rule tracks the rate of requests for each originating IP
   * address, and triggers the rule action when the rate exceeds a limit that you
   * specify on the number of requests in any 5-minute time span. You can use this to
   * put a temporary block on requests from an IP address that is sending excessive
   * requests. </p> <p>WAF tracks and manages web requests separately for each
   * instance of a rate-based rule that you use. For example, if you provide the same
   * rate-based rule settings in two web ACLs, each of the two rule statements
   * represents a separate instance of the rate-based rule and gets its own tracking
   * and management by WAF. If you define a rate-based rule inside a rule group, and
   * then use that rule group in multiple places, each use creates a separate
   * instance of the rate-based rule that gets its own tracking and management by
   * WAF. </p> <p>When the rule action triggers, WAF blocks additional requests from
   * the IP address until the request rate falls below the limit.</p> <p>You can
   * optionally nest another statement inside the rate-based statement, to narrow the
   * scope of the rule so that it only counts requests that match the nested
   * statement. For example, based on recent requests that you have seen from an
   * attacker, you might create a rate-based rule with a nested AND rule statement
   * that contains the following nested statements:</p> <ul> <li> <p>An IP match
   * statement with an IP set that specified the address 192.0.2.44.</p> </li> <li>
   * <p>A string match statement that searches in the User-Agent header for the
   * string BadBot.</p> </li> </ul> <p>In this rate-based rule, you also define a
   * rate limit. For this example, the rate limit is 1,000. Requests that meet both
   * of the conditions in the statements are counted. If the count exceeds 1,000
   * requests per five minutes, the rule action triggers. Requests that do not meet
   * both conditions are not counted towards the rate limit and are not affected by
   * this rule.</p> <p>You cannot nest a <code>RateBasedStatement</code> inside
   * another statement, for example inside a <code>NotStatement</code> or
   * <code>OrStatement</code>. You can define a <code>RateBasedStatement</code>
   * inside a web ACL and inside a rule group. </p><p><h3>See Also:</h3>   <a
