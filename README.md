# AWS SDK for C++
The AWS SDK for C++ provides a modern C++ (version C++ 11 or later) interface for Amazon Web Services (AWS). It is meant to be performant and fully functioning with low- and high-level SDKs, while minimizing dependencies and providing platform portability (Windows, OSX, Linux, and mobile).

AWS SDK for C++ is in now in General Availability and recommended for production use. We invite our customers to join
the development efforts by submitting pull requests and sending us feedback and ideas via GitHub Issues.

## Version 1.9 is now Available!

This release introduces a new Amazon S3 client, providing high throughput for Amazon S3 GET and PUT operations. The all new S3 Client is implemented on the top of the AWS Common Runtime (CRT) libraries, and is aptly named the "S3 CRT client". Lastly, there are also configuration updates related to Endpoint Discovery.

All CRT libraries are git submodules of SDK for C++. It requires changes in git syntax to get all source code.
* New users: If you haven't downloaded the source code for SDK for C++, you can get all git submodules recursively by:
   ```
   git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/aws/aws-sdk-cpp
   ```
* Existing users: If youâ€™ve already downloaded source code for SDK for C++, e.g. in directory `aws-sdk-cpp`, you can update the git submodule by:
   ```
   cd aws-sdk-cpp
   git checkout main
   git pull origin main
   git submodule update --init --recursive
   ```
* Alternatively, if you downloaded the code bundle from GitHub website and have no installation of git, you can download all the dependencies running the `prefetch_crt_dependency.sh` script from the root of the repository. It will download bundles of all dependencies from github website using curl and expand them in the right locations.


See Wiki page [Improving S3 Throughput with AWS SDK for CPP v1.9](https://github.com/aws/aws-sdk-cpp/wiki/Improving-S3-Throughput-with-AWS-SDK-for-CPP-v1.9) for more details, and create a new [issue](https://github.com/aws/aws-sdk-cpp/issues/new/choose) or [pull request](https://github.com/aws/aws-sdk-cpp/compare) if you have any feedback on this new version.

## Upgrade Your SDK to Get Latest Security Patches
The AWS SDK for C++ has a dependency on cJSON. This dependency was updated to version 1.7.14 in the recent SDK updates. We would recommend to upgrade your SDK to version 1.9.67 for 1.9.x or 1.8.187 for 1.8.x. Thank @dkalinowski for reporting this issue: https://github.com/aws/aws-sdk-cpp/issues/1594

# Getting Started

## Building the SDK:

### Minimum Requirements:
* Visual Studio 2015 or later
* OR GNU Compiler Collection (GCC) 4.9 or later
* OR Clang 3.3 or later
* 4GB of RAM
  * 4GB of RAM is required to build some of the larger clients. The SDK build may fail on EC2 instance types t2.micro, t2.small and other small instance types due to insufficient memory.

### Building From Source:

#### To create an **out-of-source build**:
1. Install CMake and the relevant build tools for your platform. Ensure these are available in your executable path.
2. Create your build directory. Replace <BUILD_DIR> with your build directory name:

3. Build the project:

   * For Auto Make build systems:
   ```sh
   cd <BUILD_DIR>
   cmake <path-to-root-of-this-source-code> -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug -DCMAKE_PREFIX_PATH=<path-to-install>
   make
   make install
   ```

   * For Visual Studio:
   ```sh
   cd <BUILD_DIR>
   cmake <path-to-root-of-this-source-code> -G "Visual Studio 15 Win64" -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug -DCMAKE_PREFIX_PATH=<path-to-install>
   msbuild ALL_BUILD.vcxproj /p:Configuration=Debug
   ```

   * For macOS - Xcode:
   ```sh
   cmake <path-to-root-of-this-source-code> -G Xcode -DTARGET_ARCH="APPLE" -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug -DCMAKE_PREFIX_PATH=<path-to-install>
   xcodebuild -target ALL_BUILD
   ```
#### Other Dependencies:
To compile in Linux, you must have the header files for libcurl, libopenssl. The packages are typically available in your package manager.

Debian example:
   `sudo apt-get install libcurl-dev`

### Building for Android
To build for Android, add `-DTARGET_ARCH=ANDROID` to your cmake command line. Currently we support Android APIs from 19 to 28 with Android NDK 19c and we are using build-in cmake toolchain file supplied by Android NDK, assuming you have the appropriate environment variables (ANDROID_NDK) set.

##### Android on Windows
Building for Android on Windows requires some additional setup.  In particular, you will need to run cmake from a Visual Studio developer command prompt (2015 or higher). Additionally, you will need 'git' and 'patch' in your path.  If you have git installed on a Windows system, then patch is likely found in a sibling directory (.../Git/usr/bin/). Once you've verified these requirements, your cmake command line will change slightly to use nmake:

   ```sh
   cmake -G "NMake Makefiles" `-DTARGET_ARCH=ANDROID` <other options> ..
   ```

Nmake builds targets in a serial fashion.  To make things quicker, we recommend installing JOM as an alternative to nmake and then changing the cmake invocation to:

   ```sh
   cmake -G "NMake Makefiles JOM" `-DTARGET_ARCH=ANDROID` <other options> ..
   ```

### Building for Docker

To build for Docker, ensure your container meets the [minimum requirements](#minimum-requirements). By default, Docker Desktop is set to use 2 GB runtime memory. We have provided [Dockerfiles](https://github.com/aws/aws-sdk-cpp/tree/master/CI/docker-file) as templates for building the SDK in a container.
