     * – The maximum amount in USD that you are willing to spend each month to send SMS
     * messages. When Amazon SNS determines that sending an SMS message would incur a
     * cost that exceeds this limit, it stops sending SMS messages within minutes.</p>
     * <important> <p>Amazon SNS stops sending SMS messages within minutes of the limit
     * being crossed. During that interval, if you continue to send SMS messages, you
     * will incur costs that exceed your limit.</p> </important> <p>By default, the
     * spend limit is set to the maximum allowed by Amazon SNS. If you want to exceed
     * the maximum, contact <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/premiumsupport/">AWS
     * Support</a> or your AWS sales representative for a service limit increase.</p>
     * <p> <code>DeliveryStatusIAMRole</code> – The ARN of the IAM role that allows
     * Amazon SNS to write logs about SMS deliveries in CloudWatch Logs. For each SMS
     * message that you send, Amazon SNS writes a log that includes the message price,
     * the success or failure status, the reason for failure (if the message failed),
     * the message dwell time, and other information.</p> <p>
     * <code>DeliveryStatusSuccessSamplingRate</code> – The percentage of successful
     * SMS deliveries for which Amazon SNS will write logs in CloudWatch Logs. The
     * value can be an integer from 0 - 100. For example, to write logs only for failed
     * deliveries, set this value to <code>0</code>. To write logs for 10% of your
     * successful deliveries, set it to <code>10</code>.</p> <p>
     * <code>DefaultSenderID</code> – A string, such as your business brand, that is
     * displayed as the sender on the receiving device. Support for sender IDs varies
     * by country. The sender ID can be 1 - 11 alphanumeric characters, and it must
     * contain at least one letter.</p> <p> <code>DefaultSMSType</code> – The type of
     * SMS message that you will send by default. You can assign the following
     * values:</p> <ul> <li> <p> <code>Promotional</code> – (Default) Noncritical
     * messages, such as marketing messages. Amazon SNS optimizes the message delivery
     * to incur the lowest cost.</p> </li> <li> <p> <code>Transactional</code> –
     * Critical messages that support customer transactions, such as one-time passcodes
     * for multi-factor authentication. Amazon SNS optimizes the message delivery to
     * achieve the highest reliability.</p> </li> </ul> <p>
     * <code>UsageReportS3Bucket</code> – The name of the Amazon S3 bucket to receive
     * daily SMS usage reports from Amazon SNS. Each day, Amazon SNS will deliver a
     * usage report as a CSV file to the bucket. The report includes the following
     * information for each SMS message that was successfully delivered by your
