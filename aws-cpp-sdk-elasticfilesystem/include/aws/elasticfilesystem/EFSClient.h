         * primary private IP address).</li> <li>If the request provides
         * <code>SecurityGroups</code>, this network interface is associated with those
         * security groups. Otherwise, it belongs to the default security group for the
         * subnet's VPC.</li> <li>Assigns the description <code>"Mount target
         * <i>fsmt-id</i> for file system <i>fs-id</i>"</code> where
         * <code><i>fsmt-id</i></code> is the mount target ID, and
